                insert:  This inserts new user information in a new row (degrages searchability).
                         Useful when you want to save all user changes and when that info was updated.
                replace: This replaces all the current user information in the database with the new information.
                         Useful when you only care about the most recent user information.

    -w         Crawl user's wall posts and add to wall table.
    -f         Crawl user's friends and add to friends table.

                3 - friendception
    -url       Crawl these url(s) and also crawl the user's friends if -depth > 1
                example: -url http://fb.com/profile.php?id=12345,profile.php?id=54321,john.smith.3
    -name      Search for and crawl these name(s) and also crawl the user's friends if -depth > 1.
               This works by using Facebook's search by and using the first result. For more precision use -url.

PLUG-INS
    
    fb-crawl.pl will open a perl script that can analyze and modify user information before it goes into the database.
    The script should contain a function with the same name as the file.
    The function is passed a hash reference with the current user's information in it.
    
    To load a plug-in use the -plugins option:
    $ ./fb-crawl.pl -u email@address -i -plugins location2latlon.pl,birthday2date.pl
    
    location2latlon.pl:
    This plug-in adds the user's coordinates to the database using the Google Geocoding API.
    
    birthday2date.pl:
    This plug-in convert the user's birthday to MySQL date (YYYY-MM-DD) format.
    
    See plugin files for implementation details.
